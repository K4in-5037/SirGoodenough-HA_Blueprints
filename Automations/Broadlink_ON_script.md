This is a SCRIPT Blueprint that uses my Broadlink RM3 to turn my TV on and get it into the correct mode, IE: antenna, FireTV, Chromecast, etc.  The defaults are specific to me and you should change them to match your situation. 

## :arrow_down: Get Started

Updates will be published on my [GIST repository ](https://gist.github.com/SirGoodenough) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection.

## :page_facing_up: Description 

You can import the script blueprint via the button above or manually as below.
To import this Blueprint: 
> • Open Home Assistant with administrator privileges and on a Lovelace screen, click anywhere in the main entity area and type the letter ‘c’.  A selection box should pop up.  Type blue and select the button to navigate to blueprints.  You can also find blueprints by selecting configuration from the left menu and then blueprints from the center menu.
> • Once there, click on the ‘Import Blueprint’ button in the lower right side of the main screen.
> • In the ‘URL of the blueprint’ line type or paste in the URL of my Blueprint. I have the blueprint stored on my Public GIST on GitHub:
>  ◦   ```https://gist.github.com/SirGoodenough/d530280dc4177aa2882bc3e7924982d5```

This is my version and has defaults specific to my system that will need to be changed for your system,  Also if an !input has a default, the calling script is not required to include input data for that !input, but if you want to change the input values without editing the blueprint defaults, then add more selectors to overwrite with your desired values.
