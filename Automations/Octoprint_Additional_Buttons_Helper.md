## 🔮 About this blueprint

Type of blueprint: AUTOMATION

Why do I need this?

> This is Blueprint is provided as a helper for people using the Octoprint Plugin called [OctoPrint-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/cmroche/OctoPrint-HomeAssistant).  Within that Plugin there are several suggested Home Assistant Lovelace/Dashboard based functions, and this will build them all for you.
> This gives you those optional features suggested in this plug-in's README plus gives you Home Assistant buttons you can call from scripts and automations to activate them.


## 🔧 Configuration

Requirements

* The [OctoPrint-MQTT](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/mqtt/) plug-in installed.
* The [OctoPrint-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/cmroche/OctoPrint-HomeAssistant) plugin installed.
* You will also need to be connected to an MQTT Broker that your Home Assistant instance is also connected to. Set-up for all that is covered within those packages.
* Mains power to the printer, Pi, and associated equipment connectd thru one or more Home Assistant controllable smart switches.

## 👀 How do I find the info for the first 3 inputs?

The information for these is located in your OctoPrint Dashboard.  The assumption is that you have the 2 required plugins installed and OctoPrint-Homeassistant is set-up and working first.

Start by opening your OctoPrint Dashboard.  Click the wrench and find the MQTT Plugin.
![Find OctoPrint Wrench](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/OctoprintWrench.png?raw=true "Find OctoPrint Wrench")
![Find OctoPrint Wrench](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/OctoprintMQTTMenu.png?raw=true "Find OctoPrint Wrench")

Once here, click the Topics Tab.
Copy exactly the text located in the ```Base topic``` box.  All capitalization, punctuation, & spaces are required to match up the Blueprint buttons with the original installation. Plug that into the first input for MQTT Topic.
![Find OctoPrint Wrench](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/OctoprintBaseTopic.png?raw=true "Find OctoPrint Wrench")

Next select the HomeAssistant Discovery tab on the left
![Find OctoPrint Wrench](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/OctoprintHAMenu.png?raw=true "Find OctoPrint Wrench")

Copy all the text in the Node ID box and plug that into the second input for the Device_ID / Node ID Input in the Blueprint.
![Find OctoPrint Wrench](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/OctoprintNodeID.png?raw=true "Find OctoPrint Wrench")

Finally locate the Device name in the same tab. Copy that for the third input device name.

## 🌞 ❄️ Troubleshooting tip

If you are troubleshooting and you want to see more traces back when doing so, here is a TIP I've found.
Manually edit the automation created with the ui editor (or manually with a text editor) and add the following to have this automation contain 10 traces instead of the normal 5. Then if the automation is triggering often, you can see the last 10 traces to help you decide what the issue is.
[HA Docs on this here.](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/#traces)

```yaml
trace:
  stored_traces: 10
```

## 📩 **Version Updates**

Updates will be published on my [GIT repository](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection.

📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST** Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. [🔗koter84 Blueprint Update Script ](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)
