Type of blueprint: AUTOMATION

## Configuration
Requirements

    Tasmota SV Device set-up to receive the output of this blueprint.
    Suitable Humidifier to control

    minimum_time: Current default 20 seconds. Must be set lower than the maximum time. This it the shortest time that will be sent to the switch.

    maximum_time: Current default 80 seconds. Must be set higher than the minimum time. This it the longest time that will be sent to the switch. It is also used in the formula to calculate the time sent to the switch.

## Where is My MQTT Topic?

The Blueprint needs to send the time value to var2 in your sonoff SV.  On my system the MQTT topic to do this is cmnd/humidifier/var2.  Yours will be something similar.  In order to determine exactly what your will be, follow these instructions.
