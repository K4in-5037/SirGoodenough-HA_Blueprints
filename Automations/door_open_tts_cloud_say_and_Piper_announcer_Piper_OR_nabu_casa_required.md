Works with BOTH Piper and Nabu-Casa tts-cloud-say. This blueprint is set up to watch a binary sensor. When it goes from off to on (closed to open) it triggers a message to be sent to the google enabled speaker of your choice. The message will play after a delay you set and repeat on that same delay until the switch returns to off (closed), at which time it sends a different message. The delay time and all the other parameters are adjustable.

## üîÆ About this blueprint

Type of blueprint: AUTOMATION

What if I am having problems getting it going?

> You can contact me for help, [see the links below](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/door_open_tts_cloud_say_announcer_nabu_casa_required.md#contacts).

Why do I need this?

> This is a TTS.cloud-say version of another Door Announcer I found in the HA Blueprint Exchange. For people that have Nabu-Casa, TTS.cloud-say is far superior to TTS.google_say as it adds languages and gender to the voices available. If you are a Nabu-Casa subscriber, I highly recommend using this.

> There are ways to enable the announcement only during time slots and/or specific weekdays, so you **could** have a different message every day of the week...

## üîß Configuration

Requirements

* 1 binary_sensor entities to sense the action you are announcing
* 1 media_player, group of media _players, or list of media_players to send the words to
* Pick a gender and language from https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/
* Pick a voice from https://github.com/NabuCasa/hass-nabucasa/blob/master/hass_nabucasa/voice.py
  
  ***NOTE: For version 2023-10-02 the filename was changed to reflect the large change in function. To update, import the new Blueprint, and edit the prior automation to use the filename for the new BluePrint. Then delete the old BluePrint. Your old Automation for the prior version is compatible with the new blueprint with the exception of the path/name.***

## üóÇ Input fields

    tts_service: 'Text to Speech Processor'
        Select the configured TTS engine for media_player notifications.
        [SEE for details](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech)

    door_entity: 'Door Sensor (or any binary_sensor will do...)'
        Entity that causes the announcement. Actually any entity that 
        changes its state from off to on will work here, You would
        just need to enter the entity manually if it's not a
        binary sensor.

    reminded: 'Did I remind you?'
        This is optional.
        You can leave this at the default (empty) and the behavior of the BP will
        be exactly what it was in the past. This ensures your old set-up will not
        break if you upgrade the BluePrint.
        Or if you create an 'input_boolean'/'toggle' helper and put the name in
        here, the behavior will be the door is silent as long as you do not
        exceed the time it takes to get to the warning message that the door is
        open. If that warning message triggers once, it will then thank you after
        you close it.

    start_time: StartTime
        Time of day you want to enable the announcement each day.

    end_time: EndTime
        Time of day you want to disable the announcement each day. 

    speaker_target: Speaker
        Entity to announce event on

    speaker_gender: Speaker Gender
        Select speaker gender male or female

    speaker_language: Speaker Language
        Select Language code.
        [See here for Details](https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/)

    speaker_voice: tts_cloud (Nabu Casa) Voice
        ***Here you need to be careful.***
        If you are OK with the default voice then just leave this field empty.
        If you want to change the voice, you need to pick from [This List, TTS_VOICES section](https://github.com/NabuCasa/hass-nabucasa/blob/master/hass_nabucasa/voice.py)
        being certain to match the country code you picked above with one of
        the voices available for that country code on that list.

    piper_voice: Voice option for the Piper addon played thru Wyoming
        Used only on Piper.
        [Voice List Here](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/blob/main/voices.json)
        Also available in the Add-on UI configuration dropdown.
        If a new one is available you can enter it manually.

    announcement_message: Announcement message
        What to say when door is opened.
        The variable {{ door }} is available if you want the dynamic
          friendly_name of the device that triggered.
        This can be set to "" if you do not want a message while sensor is active.

    final_message: Final message
        What to say when door is closed.
        The variable {{ door }} is available if you want the dynamic
          friendly_name of the device that triggered.
        This can be set to "" if you do not want a message after the sensor is reset.

    cooldown: Announcement cooldown
        The minimum number of seconds needed before AND between between
        announcements.

    additional_conditions:
        Extra conditions you may want to add to this automation 
        (Example: Home occupied, TV on, etc)

### üß¨ Walk-thru:

> 1. The header of the Blueprint contains the required info plus the URL from where it came from.
> 2. The input: section is where it gets the information it needs to fill in the blanks. This information is stored in the actual automation referencing this Blueprint when executing the task.
> 3. The Trigger section will start everything when your Binary Sensor changes state from off to on.
> 4. Once triggered it goes into a repeat loop that starts with the delay time selected. This repeat loop will immediately abort if the  binary sensor flips back to off. If the binary sensor stays on long enough to get passed the delay time, the initial announcement will be sent to the speaker and it will cycle back to the top and start the repeat loop again.
> 5. When the binary_sensor flips to off it will play the closing message,

## üåû ‚ùÑÔ∏è Troubleshooting tip

If you are troubleshooting and you want to see more traces back when doing so, here is a TIP I've found.
Manually edit the automation created with the ui editor (or manually with a text editor) and add the following to have this automation contain 10 traces instead of the normal 5. Then if the automation is triggering often, you can see the last 10 traces to help you decide what the issue is.
[HA Docs on this here.](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/#traces)

```yaml
trace:
  stored_traces: 10
```

## üì© **Version Updates**

Updates will be published on my [GIT repository](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection.

üì© There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST** Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint.
