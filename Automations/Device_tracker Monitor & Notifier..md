This Blueprint monitors device_tracker entities that you choose & notifies you if they go offline. Then it gives you the opportunity to devise an action to deal with it.  It started as a pfSense centered project but any device_tracker that has a state of home when it is running and something else when it is not available will work with this.

## 📑 Changelog

* **2022-12-10**: 🎉 First Released Version.

## 📩 * Version Updates

Updates will be published on my [GIT repository](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection.

🔗 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints.  However I have found something that comes pretty close.  It is not perfect, but for **MOST** Blueprints, it does just fine.  I encourage you to check this script out and use it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint.

## 📖 Description

This is intended to be used with pfSense HACS Integration: 
[GitHub - travisghansen/hass-pfsense: pfSense integration with Home Assistant](https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-pfsense)

However it could be used with any device tracker that reports ```home``` when the 
device is up and something else when it isn't.

It will create a persistent notification when triggered. 
Triggers / notifications can be enabled for a time period each day and/or for 
specific days of the week. There is also the ability to roll your own specific 
notification or other action as an action statement.

I also found that Awesome Blueprints Matt has a blueprint to send this stuff 
to your phone, so I referenced that here to be helpful if you are looking for that.
If you want to send these notifications to a mobile device, i suggest you look at
the following blueprint to use in conjunction with this blueprint. I am not 
affiliated with that, but decided I didn't want to re-invent the wheel as 
mobile HA is not something I do every day.

## 🐘 Requirements

### Persistent Notification Integration Required

You must have this integration enabled on your system to run the automation, since 
the these notifications are generated by this integration. This should be 
activated in yur HA Instance by default, so unless you tweaked the default 
configuration, you''re good to go.

### [Persistent Notification Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/persistent_notification/)

##### 🛠 Installation

* Open Home Assistant with administrator privileges and on a Lovelace screen, click anywhere in the main entity area and type the letter ‘c’.  A selection box should pop up.  Type blue and select the button to navigate to blueprints.  You can also find blueprints by selecting configuration from the left menu and then blueprints from the center menu.
* Once there, click on the ‘Import Blueprint’ button in the lower right side of the main screen.
* In the ‘URL of the blueprint’ line type or paste in the URL of my Blueprint. I have the blueprint stored on my Public GitHub:

> ◦ https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints

#### 🧬 To make the blueprint work it will need

Once you have the entities created or decided upon you can build the Automation.  To build the automation:  

> 1. Click on 'Create Automation'  [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your automations.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/automations.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/) and 'Use Blueprint'
> 2. Add a Description so you can tell what this one is for
> 3. Use the Drop-downs to select the Entities for the listed purposes.
> 4. Set the time-frame that the automation will be active.  Default is always on.
> 5. Select the device you want to monitor.
> 6. Write the yaml scripting to perform your own actions, or just use the persistent notification that's already written for you.
> 
![Sample UI Data entry screen with optional notification_id.](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/images/ui_sample_screen.png?raw=true "Sample UI Data entry screen with optional notification_id")


Here are some of the variables you might want if writing you're own notification thru notify, pushbullet, texting, notify, telegram, or whatever:

> Name of the triggered entity: ```{{ states[trigger.to_state.entity_id].name }}```
> 
> State of the triggered entity: ```{{ states[trigger.to_state.entity_id].state }}```
> 
> Friendy_name of the triggered entity: ```{{ states[trigger.to_state.entity_id].friendly_name }}```
> 
> Others are available if you look at the persistent_notification because it shows you all that are available from that sensor:

## 🌞 ❄️ Troubleshooting tip

If you are troubleshooting and you want to see more traces back when doing so, here is a TIP I've found.
Manually edit the automation created with the ui editor (or manually with a text editor) and add the following to have this automation contain 10 traces instead of the normal 5.  Then if the automation is triggering often, you can see the last 10 traces to help you decide what the issue is.

```yaml
alias: aaaaaaa office Fan Test
description: 'See how to increase the number of Traces available''
trace:
  stored_traces: 10
use_blueprint:
.....
```
