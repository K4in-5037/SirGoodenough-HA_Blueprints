ðŸ“£ This is a script that can use any of the 11 integrated TTS Platforms in Home Assistant to send a message to a media player. Some will require Google Type Speakers, some will require Non-Google type speakers.

## :arrow_down: Get Started

Updates will be published on my [GIT repository ](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints) with the rest of my Home Assistant Blueprint collection. 
The main problem I had with this blueprint is that I do not have all TTS platforms installed in my system, sio there is no way I can test everything.  I installed what I could and tested those. Others I just have made available the basic configuration of the tts*_say flavor, speaker entity, and message. If the integration page gave me more specific information, I went with that as options.

#### I am visioning this as a community project. The Github files are available for forking and PR's. Also you can post suggestions in the community tab or on my Discord and we can make changes as changes need to be made.  I cannot install and pay for all the versions of TTS out there, and I have not covered any of the custom integrations because I simply do not now what there is a demand for.  So if you have ideas and want to help test stuff or want to add some code, let's have fun!

**NOTE:** This blueprint replaces 2 other blueprints, so those have been removed from the repository.  All the functionality in those has been moved to this one.
* tts_cloud_message_script.yaml
* tts_google_translate_say_message_script.yaml

All constructive help is encouraged.

## :page_facing_up: Description

These integrations are listed here. Please refer to these pages for care and feeding of the *tts_say method you choose.
â›“ https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#text-to-speech

This blueprint **WILL NOT** set-up TTS for you. You will be given the opportunity to add the incorrect options that will **NOT** allow your TTS to function. Your best road to success will be to add a TTS session with UI, and only after that is successfully talking to you should you take the languages and options that work there and apply them in this Blueprint. The safest thing to do other than that is to start with the basic sonfiguration for the TTS_say integration that you are using and add options one at a time after you have it working on a base level. 

The very basic requirements are for you to provide the *tts_say method that you have installed and tested, the entity that you want to send it to, and the message you want to send. Beyond that likely involves trial and error that may best be done in the Developer Tools Services area here:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your service developer tools.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/developer_services.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/)

:caution: ***This Blueprint makes the assumption that you already have a tested & proven TTS integration installed and you know how it works and how to use it.*** :caution:

You will need to verify that the name you have given to the TTS integration in your system configuration is the Default name or you need to change this blueprint to use the custom name you have set in the tts: section of configuration.yaml. ðŸ”š

## :gear: Usage
### Installation
You can import the script blueprint via the button above or manually as below, however it does not show in the UI as there is no Script Blueprint UI and it is not an Automation Blueprint. 
To import this Blueprint: 
>  - Open Home Assistant with administrator privileges and on a Lovelace screen, click anywhere in the main entity area and type the letter â€˜câ€™.  A selection box should pop up.  Type blue and select the button to navigate to blueprints.  You can also find blueprints by selecting configuration from the left menu and then blueprints from the center menu.
>  - Once there, click on the â€˜Import Blueprintâ€™ button in the lower right side of the main screen.
>  - In the â€˜URL of the blueprintâ€™ line type or paste in the URL of my Blueprint. I have the blueprint stored on my Public REPO on GitHub:
>  â—¦   ```https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Scripts/tts_All_Message_Script_Blueprint.yaml```

### Home Assistant
Once installed, go into blueprints and use this to add a script with your variables.  Answer the required questions and you can change or ignore the ones with defaults.  Remember the name you typed in.  For this example, we will suppose you named the script: 
```TTS Test One```
After that, where ever you want this TTS to sound off in another script or an automation, you simply add a service:  (See full examples in my configuration, link below.)

```yaml
- service: script.tts_test_one
```

This makes your automation very clean looking and you move all the 'noisy' code elsewhere.  It has greatly improved my ability to think out automations.  This also keeps me from having to write the same code over and over for every TTS I want to send out.  I have almost 30 different messages in my [Home Assistant Configuration](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/Home-Assistant-Config) 

## :bulb: Fun Ideas
This is a very simple sample test case, I wanted to see if it would work. To my delight I have been replacing all the TTS instances in my configuration with blueprints. It puts all the mess in one place. To call a specific message, I just fire the calling script and I have a 1 liner, done.

I have recently found that the !input will accept templates. Who knew, right? I have a few TTS instances that call for a random response, I just need the sound for timing of something I'm doing, and I found that something like this craziness works. It is the lyrics from a song and when triggered, it just picks one of them to play using random. It also picks a random language to speak the message from the list.  Pretty slick, right?

#### Play Media File Script Blueprint Blueprint

This is a SCRIPT Blueprint. This provides a way to play canned media files with the big long list of YAML entries but keep the main script or automation clean. 

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/script-blueprint-to-play-media-player-files-not-an-automation-blueprint/371988

#### TTS All Message Blueprint

This script can use any of the 11 integrated TTS Platforms in Home Assistant to send a message to a media player.



## Automations:
#### Auto Fan Control Blueprint

This Blueprint is for controlling a 3 speed fan based on a temperature sensor.  Intended for Ifan03/Ifan04 but useful other places.
