**Ground Rules**
Before you report a 'Bug', you need to make sure you have read the accompanying *.md file or Community Exchange post main file completely and followed all the settings required there.
This is important as if these instructions are not followed, you will likely have a bad day and be forced to contact me for help.  Not that I don't want to help, but personal interaction takes me a while to respond and is generally non-productive.

Issues are not a place to ask questions, see the Discord links below for that.  This is for broken things.  If you are not sure, PLEASE go to Discord and ask the question first.

If you have a general question, I prefer them to be asked on Discord.  Ping me in the channel, I don't often respond to DM's...   @sirgoodenough  

I also monitor the Blueprint Exchange post related to each Blueprint and will respond there.

There are 3 places on Discord that I monitor, in preference order:

My personal Discord HA Channel:  https://discord.gg/EqtsKMHAhv
DrZzs Blueprint channel:                 https://discord.gg/jvk7yEFyX3
Homa Assistant Blueprint Channel: https://discord.gg/jPPvqsWwzh

Do if you think you found a bug where the text points you wrong, or something is just broken, continue here.  If you have a Feature Request, see the other Issue Template...
