# This is an action statement that you can use in your Blueprint Automation 
#  to call a script (below) to dim a light when rotating the cube.

# In the blueprint automation:

rotate_cw_face_3:
  - service: script.cube_long_short_toggle
    data:
      angle: '{{ trigger.payload_json.action_angle | float(0.0)}}'
      short_entity: light.kitchen_down_lights
      long_entity: light.kitchensink

# These are the standalone scripts that are 'called' from the Script 
#  calling yaml shown above.

# If you want to create the long / short rotation switch script file using a script BluePrint, 
#  I have that for you right here:

# This uses

# Changing it to homeassistant.turn_on or homeassistant.turn_off would change the behavior
