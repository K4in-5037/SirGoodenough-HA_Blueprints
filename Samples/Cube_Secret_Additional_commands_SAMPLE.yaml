# This is an action statement that you can use in your Blueprint Automation 
#  to trigger a side 5 from side 2 action but ONLY if
#  the action is slide.
#
# In the blueprint automation:
#   https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/

    # This one prevents any actions that are from side 2 from activating.
    #  It allows you to use a regularly triggered slide with
    #  the secret 5_from_2 below.

  - condition: template
    value_template: '{{ not last_side == 2 }}'
  - service: light.toggle
    data: {}
    target:

    # This alows action in the side 5_from_2 action only if the
    #  action is a slide.
    #
    # You could use a choose here and have a secret 5_from_2 plus a
    #  regular 5_from_2 action.
