# Add this template trigger to create a sensor to monitor
#  the actions that the Blueprint is reacting to.
# This is an optional thing for troubleshooting issues
#  and is not required for the function of the device.
#
# This could be used as a package, or import the code into 
#  your own configuration.yaml as you see fit.
