# This is an action statement that you can use in your Blueprint Automation 
#  to call a script (below) to change volume on a media player when rotating the cube.
#
# In the blueprint automation:
#   https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/


  scene_rotate_cw_face_3:
    - service: script.aaaaaaaaabbbbbtestvolume
      data:
        angle: '{{ trigger.payload_json.action_angle | default(0.1) | float(0.2) }}'
        mp: media_player.farg
  scene_rotate_ccw_face_3:
    - service: script.aaaaaaaaabbbbbtestvolume
      data:
        angle: '{{ trigger.payload_json.action_angle | default(0.1) | float(0.2) }}'
        mp: media_player.farg

# Then this is the script that's called to do the heavy lifting.
#  It works for both CW and CCW cube rotations.
# Adjust the scalar below to make the movement more
#  sensitive or less sensitive. (bigger = more sensitive)
#
# If you want to create the script file using a script BluePrint, 
#  I have that for you right here: 
#  Dimmer Control BluePrint:
